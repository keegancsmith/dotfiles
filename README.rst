==========
 Dotfiles
==========

Collection of my linux settings. This should all work with the latest Ubuntu
currently out. There are some external programs I use which are not in
Ubuntu. These should be on somewhere on the $PATH

Usage
=====

Just run `./sync` and make sure the external programs are installed.

External Programs
=================

* http://github.com/sargon/trayer-srg - trayer fork for notification area in
  xmonad
* http://vc.gerg.ca/hg/vcprompt/ - Display version control information about
  your current directory in bash. If it is missing $PS1 won't include it.
